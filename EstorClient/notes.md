# Notes

## Prospects

1. On the prospect detail page, have some stats about number of quotes and how many are approved. Show if they are a good customer or not. Probably ignore if the prospect has only been sent one quote and approved.

2. An extension to the above, maybe highlight payment details (i.e. do they pay on time, or their payment terms / schedule if they're a company, or any outstanding invoices, etc)
